## known Bugs:
- script crashes if *.jar.conf is already installed catch this error

------------------------------------------------------
## things TODO:
- check which versions already are installed and give user some feadback like *'spigot-1.16.jar.conf (already installed)'* in checkbox choose versions
------------------------------------------------------
## Ideas:
- make path to /jar configurable as variable
- change Java in Conf file to {JAVA} and sed it in the install script to column3 from versions.csv
   - for this change install path for java versions or set as varaibles 
- make config file for major varisbles
- automatic install - check which jar files exists and load the corresponding .conf files
- automatic changing from configSource in config files while install to match the repo from url_installer
